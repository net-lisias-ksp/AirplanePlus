	description = Functioning like a fashionable slat drooping down. This flap is generally put in the leading edge or the front part of the wing. Not that it's a mandatory issue, it's just like that on the manual. Usage can range to reaction with pitch to help in take-offs or be used for landing in full deployment. Can sometimes be used for subtle changes in cruise speeds as well.
