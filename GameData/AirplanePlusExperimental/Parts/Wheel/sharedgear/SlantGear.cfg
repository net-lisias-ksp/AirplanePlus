	description = Sometimes there's a need to have landing gears which are diagonal from the aircraft but it's just not right when the wheels are diagonal as well. The KS-17 Landing Gear is an idea concieved for the very reason of having diagonal landing gears with wheels planted to the ground. There might be negligible problems with having the small suspension struts outstretched the way it is but it shouldn't be a problem.
