# Airplane Plus :: Changes

* 2023-0909: 26.6.2.0 (LisiasT) for KSP => 1.4.1
	+ New parts, courtesy of ColdJ!
		- `CJFiftyOne` (WMB VI "Vortex" Engine ColdJ)
		- `CJBiplanegear` (KS-H1 Fixed Landing Gear ColdJ)
	+ Attachment Nodes' sizes overhaul
		- Fixing a lot of attachment nodes from parts that weren't adhering to Stock standards
	+ Some small scattered fixes on
		- Category icons
		- `@thumbs` directory removal
			- this thing is auto generated by KSP at first run, and failures on installing these files crashes KSP. Doesn't worth the hassle to distribute them
		- Normalizing part configs for easier maintenance.
	+ Certifies the thing to run from KSP 1.4.1 to the latest!! **#HURRAY!!**
		- It's possible that this thing will also work fine on KSP 1.3.1, but I didn't checked too much - and this may change at anytime in the future. 
	+ Removes Drag0nD3str0yer parts from the distribution, as they decided to pursue their own Add'On, [Moderately Plane Related](https://github.com/Drag0nD3str0yer/Moderately-Plane-Related).
		- Users of the following recently added (and now removed) parts should install [Moderately Plane Related](https://github.com/Drag0nD3str0yer/Moderately-Plane-Related):
			- `f100intake` (K-100 Intake)  
			- `F22_Elev` (K-22A Stealth Control Surface)
