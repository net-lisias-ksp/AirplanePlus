# Airplane Plus :: Change Log

* 2024-0908: 26.6.2.2 (LisiasT) for KSP => 1.4.1
	+ Incepting the `Experimental` program, for fast tracking possible solutions for the current structural problems on the current parts without compromising (too much) the main distribution.
		- Reuse of these assets are unwise, because they can vanish, be renamed or change at any time. 
	+ Currently into the `Experimental`:
		- `CJFiftyOne` (WMB VI "Vortex" Engine ColdJ)
		- `CJBiplanegear` (KS-H1 Fixed Landing Gear ColdJ)
		- `SlantGearCJ` (KS-17 Slant Landing Gear (Rebuilt))
* 2024-0218: 26.6.2.1 (LisiasT) for KSP => 1.4.1
	+ Pulling a fast one: fixing the cause of the infamous TweakScale's warning `NULL ConfigNode for <part-path> (unholy characters on the name?). Trying partConfig instead!` at the same trying to salvage any current patchset, partset or UbioWeld made parts by keeping the meshes and textures on the original place.
		- It's deceiving because the "problem" is still there, I only moved it around to a place where TweakScale will not complain.
* 2023-0909: 26.6.2.0 (LisiasT) for KSP => 1.4.1
	+ New parts, courtesy of ColdJ!
		- `CJFiftyOne` (WMB VI "Vortex" Engine ColdJ)
		- `CJBiplanegear` (KS-H1 Fixed Landing Gear ColdJ)
	+ Attachment Nodes' sizes overhaul
		- Fixing a lot of attachment nodes from parts that weren't adhering to Stock standards
	+ Some small scattered fixes on
		- Category icons
		- `@thumbs` directory removal
			- this thing is auto generated by KSP at first run, and failures on installing these files crashes KSP. Doesn't worth the hassle to distribute them
		- Normalizing part configs for easier maintenance.
	+ Certifies the thing to run from KSP 1.4.1 to the latest!! **#HURRAY!!**
		- It's possible that this thing will also work fine on KSP 1.3.1, but I didn't checked too much - and this may change at anytime in the future. 
	+ Removes Drag0nD3str0yer parts from the distribution, as they decided to pursue their own Add'On, [Moderately Plane Related](https://github.com/Drag0nD3str0yer/Moderately-Plane-Related).
		- Users of the following recently added (and now removed) parts should install [Moderately Plane Related](https://github.com/Drag0nD3str0yer/Moderately-Plane-Related):
			- `f100intake` (K-100 Intake)  
			- `F22_Elev` (K-22A Stealth Control Surface)
			- `mk0rampintake` (Mk0 Ramp Intake)
			- `mk3s1scoop` (Mk3s1 Side Intake)
			- `shorterramp` (Shorter Ramp Intake)
			- `shortramp` (Short Ramp Intake)
			- `F100` (K-100 Super Kabre)
	+ Closes issues:
		- [#13](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/AirplanePlus/issues/13) Cargo Bays are working - from 1.3.1 to 1.12.5 (but not all of them)
		- [#12](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/AirplanePlus/issues/12) Mk3S1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage model glitch
		- [#7](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/AirplanePlus/issues/7) Remove parts from Drag0nD3str0yer
		- [#4](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/AirplanePlus/issues/4) Add proper attributions to Alioth FAR patch
		- [#2](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/AirplanePlus/issues/2) Add a Category entry to A+

	- I added two more engines to the pack. It's in the imgur album if you want to see for yourself. I also teamed up with a forum member which you could check out on the forum thread. You'll find his name in the information panel as well. He pretty much did all the performance configuration which was a massive help to me. The performance should feel way better than before.
